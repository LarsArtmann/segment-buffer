# TODO List

Short- and mid-term improvement tasks — actionable, bounded, with status.
This file tracks only work that is **not** blocked on a format change or a
missing concrete consumer. Long-term vision and raw ideas (async I/O,
envelope v2, second `SegmentStore` impl, streaming cipher, parallel flush
workers) live in [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md); shipped work lives in
[CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

Status legend: `[ ]` pending · `[~]` in progress · `[x]` done (recent entries
stay until the next CHANGELOG cut, then move out).

## Documentation polish (README + rustdoc)

- `[ ]` **Visually verify README rendering** on GitHub, docs.rs, and a narrow viewport (mobile-width). The ToC, Status block, Cargo features table, and the new `iter_from` / `open_with_report` code blocks all need a human eye — lychee catches link and anchor drift, not rendering regressions. _Standing item since 15-52 §b.3; Cargo features table and the two new code sections added this session widen the surface that needs verification._ Effort: ~15min. _(User action — requires a browser, not a code change.)_

## Design decisions deferred

- `[ ]` **Health-check primitive — needs a design decision before any code.** A `fn health(&self) -> Result<HealthReport>` that probes directory writability, lock validity, and disk space. **The design question that must be answered first:** _what does a caller learn from `health()` that they cannot learn from `stats()` + a trial `append()`?_ Three candidate designs, each with a reason it might be Verschlimmbessern:

  | Design                            | What it does                                              | Why it might make things worse                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
  | --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | `health()` wraps `stats()`        | Returns pressure, seq, disk bytes                         | **Redundant.** `stats()` already returns this. Adding a method that repackages it is API bloat with zero new information.                                                                                                         |
  | `health()` writes a sentinel file | Write + delete a `.healthcheck` file to probe writability | **Actively harmful on a near-full filesystem.** The write itself can fail (ENOSPC), and writing to a disk you're checking is healthy can worsen the condition.                                                                    |
  | `health()` checks free disk space | Statfs/GetDiskFreeSpace to report free bytes              | **Platform dependency.** Needs a new crate (`nix`, `winapi`, or `fs2`) for a feature that `store_pressure()` already approximates. Cross-platform free-space queries have subtle differences (available vs free vs total blocks). |

  **Current verdict:** defer until a concrete consumer needs it. The canonical health check today is: call `stats()` for pressure, call `append()` with a trivial item and check for `Err` — the error is already typed (`SegmentError::Io` with `IoSite`). If a consumer needs lock-validity checking, the `Drop` impl already panics if the lock file was tampered with; an explicit probe adds little. **Un-defer when:** a real deployment reports that `stats() + trial append` is insufficient to detect a degraded state (e.g., lock file deleted by an external process while the buffer is open).
