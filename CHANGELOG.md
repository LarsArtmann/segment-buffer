## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-19

### Added
- `SegmentBuffer<T>` — durable bounded queue backed by zstd-compressed CBOR segment files.
  Generic over any `T: Serialize + DeserializeOwned + Clone + Send + 'static`.
- `SegmentConfig` with tunable batch size, flush interval, max disk usage, and compression level.
- `SegmentBuffer::open(dir, config)` constructor with filename-based crash recovery.
- `append()`, `flush()`, `read_from()`, `delete_acked()`, `latest_sequence()`,
  `pending_count()`, `store_pressure()`, `is_overloaded()` public API.
- `SegmentCipher` trait for pluggable at-rest encryption.
- `AesGcmCipher` (AES-256-GCM with random 12-byte nonce prefix) behind the `encryption` feature.
- `SegmentError` (thiserror-based) with `Io`, `Cbor`, `Cipher`, `Integrity` variants.
- 26 unit tests + 2 doc tests covering: basic CRUD, partial reads, limits, crash recovery,
  concurrent writers/readers (10K events, 4 writers + 1 reader), time-based auto-flush,
  error paths (corrupted zstd, truncated encrypted, wrong key, no key), encryption roundtrips,
  and pressure/overload boundary conditions.

### Fixed
- Concurrency bug in `flush()`: sequence numbers (`start_seq`, `end_seq`) are now computed
  atomically inside the mutex lock alongside taking the pending events. Previously, a race
  between concurrent `append()` calls could corrupt segment filenames by computing the
  sequence range from a stale `next_seq` read in a second lock acquisition.
- Same race in `append()`: the returned sequence number is now captured under the same lock
  as the push, not re-read after releasing the lock.

### Security
- Extracted from monitor365 and proven on 597M+ events in production.
